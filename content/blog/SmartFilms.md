We open in the passenger seat of a high-intensity car chase. Your heart is racing.

I/E SPEEDING VEHICLE - DAY
GOOD GUY is in hot pursuit, mere inches from BAD GUY’s bumper, aggressively threading the streets of Velo City.
Sqealing tires drift tight corners knocking down trash cans, scattering crowded streets and innocent shoppers.
At the straight away, Good Guy almost takes the edge when Bad Guy cuts a hard right into the busy intersection. Barely missing a school bus full of innocent children, Bad Guy slips away into the dark alleys just outside of Good Guy’s jurisdiction. Good Guy screeches to a stop.

        (frustrated)
    Dammit!

Good Guy jumps out of the car and slams his fist on the roof, scowling in defeat. There’s nothing he can do now.

EXT. SEEMINGLY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

            GOOD GUY (V.O.)
                (sternly)
    Because I'm done putting their lives at risk!

INT. GOOD GUY SECRET HEADQUARTERS - SUNSET

A tired but determined team of experts for hire contemplate this mission's unlikely success.

            GOOD GUY
        (settling, confident)
    We're just going to have to find another way.

The team quiets. Good Guy devises a new plan, presenting an extremely detailed roadmap of their new mission.


Meticulous planning turns into information overload. Three minutes of dialogue feels like a whole hour. The story is dragging.
You begin to yawn. Your heart rate has dropped from an excited 92bpm to a restful 68. There’s just too much talking. Unconsciously, you reach for your cell phone to scroll the latest social media news. The film has lost your attention.

Virtual reality opens the world to a form of communication most people can’t yet comprehend. For generations, we’ve been writing and dreaming about a future when technology brings humans together in ways our natural bodies and minds could never achieve or even process. No doubt many of us realize VR looks a lot like science fiction and the world of tomorrow, but few can see this future already exists. We’ve been carrying it in our pockets for years, using only a small percentage of its potential as an app on an otherwise very powerful computer extension of our brain. Today young people are putting that very same technology on their face to view and interact with each other in metaworlds only visible through electronics. We are in the early stages of the future. It has been sneaking up on us for a while, and is growing at a exciting rate.

But what does that look like?


Many forward thinkers speak of increased empathy and a deeper understanding of humanity through shared experiences. A way of living in another’s shoes long enough to relate to their circumstances and adjust our own lifestyle to respect and accommodate fellow humans we’re now more connected to. While this utopian belief is fantastic in theory, I would argue it is not achievable on mass scale.


“I think we’re moving into a dangerous medium with virtual reality,” Steven Spielberg said in 2016, “because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look.”

Very true. And who better to recognize this early than Spielberg, right?
However, contemporary tech disagrees. We argue that the latitude he refers to IS the new medium. Storytellers must have the courage to allow their viewers to discover the story on their own, building a unique outcome as they go. This isn’t a new idea by any means as many describe a “choose your own story” approach where viewers direct what happens next based on key decisions throughout their film experience. Take Netflix’s critically acclaimed [Black Mirror: Bandersnatch](https://www.netflix.com/title/80988062) for example. Certainly entertaining, and even re-viewable with different choices, but still based on an idea that has been shared as bedtime stories and basement board games for generations.

I’m here to take this proposed future a couple steps further. Not limited to a genre that has been here before, but one that isn’t here yet. One that requires active, daily participation in VR culture to see coming. I call them Smart Films.

Let’s start by looking at the power of technology we hold in our pockets right now. No doubt you have at least one cell phone within short reach. Filled with apps, gps maps, and fitness trackers. Now think deeper about what that means. At every given moment, your “phone” is tracking where you are, where you’ve been, how long you stayed, and how many steps it took. Add a fancy smartwatch and now it knows your heart rate too. This technology helps us find our way and care for our bodies, but what if it also told films how we feel? What if the film already knows your preferences, and adapts the story in response to your body language? THIS is the true future of film.

Put yourself in the filmmaker’s shoes. Your goal is to direct the viewer to see what you want them to see. To experience how you want them to experience. All through the window you create and capture them into. Again, I view this from a deeper perspective. Instead of trying to confine them to my world, my goal is to hold their attention no matter what world they are in. For most intents and purposes, these two are the same thing, however the second is much more open. More flexible and uncertain. It allows the viewer to remain free within the story to follow their own journey, even reaching their own destination. I can see where Steven Spielberg feels this is dangerous territory. When the viewer gets to roam freely, you lose them. But what if he had access to an algorithm that listened to each viewer’s heart rate? A film with corresponding AI trained to understand a lower heart rate indicates loss of attention?
