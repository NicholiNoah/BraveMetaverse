Satellite a9.126 dawns comfortably under the blanket of a warm horizon.
It’ll be dark soon. That’s when she remembers.

Grandmother was young when she got her implant. They forgot her years ago, but we know better. See, right around this time every year, when the sun sets between those trees and the skies clear away from the cloud… that blinky yellow light right there lines up perfectly with the horizon. Her reception comes in loud and clear. Some signal must bounce off the atmosphere or something but for like twenty minutes, she remembers stuff from a long time ago. Reliving what it was like when she was a kid. All those memories still floating around out here in the Metaverse.</i>

## **What is the Metaverse?**

It means “beyond universe”, and is going to be the big buzzword in just a few years.
For many of you, this is the first time you’ve seen that word, Metaverse. For others, the Metaverse is a video game you heard about. It's probably the future of social media. Maybe even the next World Wide Web.\
It’s also what your kids are playing around in every time they put on that VR headset..

Okay... so what exactly is the Metaverse?\
The Metaverse is where virtual reality lives. It’s an abstract new world reaching beyond our physical universe. More specifically it’s the shared space where virtual and reality converge, and home to all the extended realities. 

From video games and robots to virtual schools and working from home, the Metaverse is already developing into its own diverse community, culture, and economy. You can even get a job in the Metaverse now.

If you bought VR headsets for that big holiday your family celebrates every year, your kids have probably visited at least one Metaverse. And that’s okay because you and I interact with the Metaverse every day too. Our cellphones, smartwatch, Alexa, those big expensive tractors you see farming giant cornfields out in the country. They’re all connected to each other, humming along in harmony, communicating through a network of data and algorithms designed to make our lives better.

In other words: the Holodeck... but not quite yet.

Right now the Metaverse is a think tank of young entrepreneurs and creative coders. Kids don’t just play games. They make their own. Working together. Programming data with code blocks that connect like LEGO, not just numbers typed on a screen. It's an inspiring environment for visual learning and creative thinkers. It's also a big world with lots of stuff to learn and feels a little bit like the Wild West.
With each post, we’ll dive deeper into what the Metaverse has to offer, and how you can comfortably integrate this new tech into your family.

What would you like the Metaverse to be?

Passionate to say the least, I’ve spent the past three years immersed in the developing virtual reality culture, actively involved in VR community and educational opportunities. I bring all the yummy nuggets and hidden gems back to the real world for you to peruse at your leisure. Together we’ll explore and discuss educational programs, career paths and opportunities, intercultural communication, and children’s safety in social VR. Because we all know kids learn tech way faster than the rest of us.
