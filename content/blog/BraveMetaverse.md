metaDescription: It starts with a poem. A reflection of myself as I venture into the unknown. Focused on the future of communication. Finding who I am as I discover this new world we call Metaverse.

This is where I am now.\
Launched into a dimension without space or time.\
Nothing to grab onto. Nothing to hold. I have no control.\
No reference. No sense of movement or speed.\
Determination and courage my only guides.\
A lone explorer floating in eternity.\
